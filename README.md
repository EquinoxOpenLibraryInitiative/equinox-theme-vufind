# equinox-theme-vufind
Custom Equinox theme for VuFind

To install, copy the equinox directory to $VUFIND\_HOME/themes/

# TODO
1. Finish hooking up search home page to use channels instead of static images
1. Find a way to use some translations for data in the footer to allow easier editing
1. Make the CN browse more automatic rather than manually hiding / showing Dewey vs LC
1. Probably more.
